## Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
# Stable release
yay -S hyprwave-hifi

# Latest git
yay -S hyprwave-hifi-git
```

### Dependencies (other distros)

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev gtk4-layer-shell

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel gtk4-layer-shell-devel
```

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/godlyfast/hyprwave-hifi.git
cd hyprwave-hifi
make
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
```

System install locations:
- Binary: `/usr/bin/hyprwave`
- Resources: `/usr/share/hyprwave/`
- Toggle script: `/usr/bin/hyprwave-toggle`

User config at `~/.config/hyprwave/config.conf`

## Roon Setup

Roon requires an MPRIS bridge. The multi-zone bridge exposes all Roon zones as separate MPRIS players:

```bash
# Arch Linux (AUR)
yay -S roon-mpris-multizone-git
```

Or install from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/godlyfast/roon-mpris.git
cd roon-mpris
npm install
```

Then:
1. Run `roon-mpris` (add to autostart)
2. Open Roon -> Settings -> Extensions
3. Enable "Roon MPRIS Multi-Zone Bridge"
4. HyprWave auto-detects all zones

**Player Switching:** Click the player label in the expanded view to cycle through players. Your preference is saved automatically.

## Configuration

Edit `~/.config/hyprwave/config.conf`:

```conf
[General]
# Edge: right, left, top, bottom
edge = right
margin = 10

# Theme: light or dark
theme = dark

[Keybinds]
toggle_visibility = Super+Shift+M
toggle_expand = Super+M

[Notifications]
enabled = true
now_playing = true
```

### Custom CSS

Create `~/.config/hyprwave/user.css` to customize appearance. User CSS loads with highest priority.

Available classes: `.control-container`, `.expanded-section`, `.notification-container`, `.control-button`, `.album-cover`, `.track-title`, `.artist-label`, `.player-label`, `.track-progress`

## Keybinds

### Hyprland

Add to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:
```conf
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, M, exec, hyprwave-toggle visibility
bind = SUPER, M, exec, hyprwave-toggle expand
exec-once = hyprwave
```

### Niri

Add to `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`:
```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+M { spawn "hyprwave-toggle" "visibility"; }
    Mod+M { spawn "hyprwave-toggle" "expand"; }
}
spawn-at-startup "hyprwave"
```

### Sway

Add to `~/.config/sway/config`:
```conf
bindsym $mod+Shift+M exec hyprwave-toggle visibility
bindsym $mod+M exec hyprwave-toggle expand
```

## Troubleshooting

### Black box around HyprWave (Hyprland)

Add to `hyprland.conf`:
```conf
layerrule = noblur, hyprwave
layerrule = noblur, hyprwave-notification
```

### Album art not loading

Some players (especially Chromium-based) use ephemeral temp files for album art. This fork includes pre-loading to handle these cases.
