## 🚀 Installation

### Dependencies
```bash
# Arch Linux / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S gtk4 gtk4-layer-shell

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev gtk4-layer-shell

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel gtk4-layer-shell-devel
```

### Building from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shantanubaddar/hyprwave.git
cd hyprwave

# Build and install
make
make install
```

The installer will:
- Copy binary to `~/.local/bin/hyprwave`
- Install resources to `~/.local/share/hyprwave/`
- Install `hyprwave-toggle` script for keybinds
- Create config at `~/.config/hyprwave/config.conf`

## 🎵 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Install and run HyprWave**: `hyprwave`
2. **Start a music player** (Spotify, VLC, etc.)
3. **Control your music** with the on-screen controls
4. **Use keybinds** for quick access (see configuration below)

### Supported Music Players

✅ **Fully Supported:**
- Spotify (Desktop app)
- TIDAL (via tidal-hifi)
- VLC Media Player
- Roon (via MPRIS bridge - see setup below)
- Cider (Apple Music client)
- Any MPRIS2-compatible player (Rhythmbox, Audacious, MPD with mpDris2, etc.)

⚠️ **Limited Support:**
- Web browsers - Filtered by default (limited MPRIS metadata)

### Roon Setup

Roon requires an MPRIS bridge to work with HyprWave. We recommend the multi-zone bridge which exposes all Roon zones as separate MPRIS players:

```bash
# Arch Linux (AUR)
yay -S roon-mpris-multizone-git
```

Or install from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/godlyfast/roon-mpris.git
cd roon-mpris
npm install
```

Then:
1. Run `roon-mpris` (add to autostart for persistence)
2. Open Roon → Settings → Extensions
3. Enable "Roon MPRIS Multi-Zone Bridge"
4. HyprWave will auto-detect all your Roon zones

**Player Switching:** Click the player label in the expanded view to cycle through all available MPRIS players (including Roon zones). Your preference is saved automatically.

**Note:** Volume control requires the Roon app directly.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Config File

Edit `~/.config/hyprwave/config.conf`:

```conf
[General]
# Edge to anchor HyprWave to
# Options: right, left, top, bottom
edge = right

# Margin from the screen edge (in pixels)
margin = 10

# Theme: light or dark
theme = light

[Keybinds]
# Keybind labels (for display in setup message)
toggle_visibility = Super+Shift+M
toggle_expand = Super+M

[Notifications]
# Enable/disable notifications
enabled = true

# Show notification when song changes
now_playing = true
```

**Layout Options:**
- **`edge = right`** - Vertical layout on right edge (default)
- **`edge = left`** - Vertical layout on left edge
- **`edge = top`** - Horizontal layout on top edge
- **`edge = bottom`** - Horizontal layout on bottom edge

**Theme Options:**
- **`theme = light`** - Light frosted glass theme (default)
- **`theme = dark`** - Dark glass theme with light text

**Notification Options:**
- **`enabled = true`** - Master switch for all notifications
- **`now_playing = true`** - Show "Now Playing" notifications when tracks change

### Custom Theme (User CSS)

Create `~/.config/hyprwave/user.css` to customize the appearance without modifying the default theme. User CSS loads with higher priority and overrides the default styles.

**Available CSS classes:**
- `.control-container` - Main button bar
- `.expanded-section` - Album details panel
- `.notification-container` - Now playing popup
- `.control-button` - Media control buttons
- `.album-cover` - Album art container
- `.track-title`, `.artist-label` - Text labels
- `.player-label` - Clickable player selector
- `.track-progress` - Progress bar
- `.notification-song`, `.notification-artist` - Notification text

### Dark Theme

A dark theme is included. To enable it, set `theme = dark` in your config file:

```conf
[General]
theme = dark
```

Then restart HyprWave. The dark theme features dark glass backgrounds with light text for better visibility on dark desktops.

**Alternative:** For full customization, you can copy the dark theme to user.css and modify it:
```bash
cp ~/.local/share/hyprwave/themes/dark.css ~/.config/hyprwave/user.css
```

### Keybinds

HyprWave supports keybinds for toggling visibility and expanding details. **Add these to your compositor config:**

#### Hyprland

Add to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```conf
# HyprWave keybinds
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, M, exec, hyprwave-toggle visibility
bind = SUPER, M, exec, hyprwave-toggle expand
```

Then reload: `hyprctl reload`

#### Niri

Add to `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+M { spawn "hyprwave-toggle" "visibility"; }
    Mod+M { spawn "hyprwave-toggle" "expand"; }
}
```

Then reload: `niri msg action reload-config`

#### Sway

Add to `~/.config/sway/config`:

```conf
# HyprWave keybinds
bindsym $mod+Shift+M exec hyprwave-toggle visibility
bindsym $mod+M exec hyprwave-toggle expand
```

Then reload: `swaymsg reload`

#### What the keybinds do:

- **Toggle Visibility** (`Super+Shift+M`) - Smoothly hides/shows entire HyprWave with slide animation
- **Toggle Expand** (`Super+M`) - Shows/hides album details
  - If HyprWave is hidden, this will show it AND expand in one smooth motion
 
  ## Here's how they will look-

### Auto-start

#### Hyprland
Add to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:
```conf
exec-once = hyprwave
```

#### Niri
Add to `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`:
```kdl
spawn-at-startup "hyprwave"
```


## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Black box around HyprWave (Hyprland)

If you see a black box around HyprWave, disable blur for the overlay:

Add to `hyprland.conf`:
```conf
layerrule = noblur, hyprwave
layerrule = noblur, hyprwave-notification
```
If that doesn't work, it most probably is a broken gtk4 or gtk4-layer-shell package- just remove them, reinstall them, and try it again.
### Notifications not appearing

1. Check that notifications are enabled in `~/.config/hyprwave/config.conf`
2. Verify both `enabled = true` and `now_playing = true` under `[Notifications]`
3. Restart HyprWave after config changes

### Keybinds not working

1. Verify `hyprwave-toggle` is installed: `which hyprwave-toggle`
2. Test manually: `hyprwave-toggle visibility` (with HyprWave running)
3. Check your compositor config for syntax errors
4. Reload your compositor config after adding keybinds

### Album art not loading

HyprWave requires the music player to provide album art URLs via MPRIS. Desktop apps work better than web browsers for this.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Language:** C
- **GUI Framework:** GTK4
- **Layer Shell:** gtk4-layer-shell (Wayland overlay)
- **IPC:** D-Bus (MPRIS2 protocol)
- **Memory:** ~80-95MB
- **CPU:** <0.3% idle, <1% during updates

### File Paths

Resources are searched in this order:
1. Local directory: `./icons/`, `./style.css` (for development)
2. User install: `~/.local/share/hyprwave/`
3. System install: `/usr/share/hyprwave/`

Config: `~/.config/hyprwave/config.conf`
